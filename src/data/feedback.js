      "OMG! When my fingers first touched my duvet cover I couldn't believe how soft it was! I have other duvet covers but I know I'll never use them again. I have an AirB&B unit and I had to order another cover to use on the duvet for the bed in there as well. People already rave about the Cozy House sheets I have on the bed. I love the zipper instead of buttons. It saves time and gives a cleaner look. You will be delighted with this product! This is a completely unsolicited review.",

      "I got my new Cosy House Luxury Comforter made with bamboo viscose and I absolutely love it! I have ovarian cancer and because of my surgery I get awful hot flashes and night sweats and with this comforter it helps keep me cool and cozy!! It's also super soft! Dog approved, hubby approved, and most importantly I approve! Normally I would expect to pay hundreds of dollars for such a luxurious item but it's UNDER $100!!!! Love my new Cosy!!",

I got the Luxury Down Alternative Comforter from Cosy House and let me tell you, this bamboo viscose fabric makes all the difference! Softer than cotton, you'll never want to sleep without it. Bonus: it's hypoallergenic and seriously obsessed with the luxurious feel. You have to order this now!!",
